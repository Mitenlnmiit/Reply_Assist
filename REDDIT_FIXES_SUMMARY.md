# Reddit Bug Fixes Summary

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. Enter Key Not Replacing Text ✅
**Root Cause:** The keyboard event handler wasn't properly intercepting Enter key events on Reddit due to event bubbling and the way Reddit's React components handle keyboard input.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed keyboard event listener to use capture phase (`addEventListener(..., true)`) to intercept events earlier
- Modified the Enter key handler to directly call `applyAll()` instead of simulating button clicks
- Added `stopImmediatePropagation()` to prevent Reddit's own handlers from interfering
- Improved focus management to ensure the replacement panel receives keyboard events

### 2. Reddit Title Box Not Detected ✅
**Root Cause:** Reddit uses custom contenteditable divs with Draft.js and Lexical editors, not standard input/textarea elements.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added Reddit-specific selectors to detect:
  - Draft.js editors (`.public-DraftEditor-content`, `.DraftEditor-editorContainer`)
  - Lexical editors (`[data-lexical-editor="true"]`)
  - Reddit title placeholders (`[placeholder*="Title"]`)
  - Various Reddit-specific contenteditable elements
- Enhanced `isTextInput()` to recognize Reddit's custom editors
- Improved `setTextInElement()` with special handling for Draft.js/Lexical editors:
  - Clears content properly before setting new text
  - Uses `execCommand` for better contenteditable compatibility
  - Triggers proper React update events (input, change, focus, blur)

### 3. Conversation Context Not Detected ✅
**Root Cause:** Reddit's comment structure uses different HTML patterns than typical chat applications.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added Reddit-specific selectors for comments and posts:
  - Comment containers: `[data-testid="comment"]`, `.Comment`, `div[id^="t1_"]`
  - Post containers: `[data-test-id="post-content"]`, `.Post`, `div[id^="t3_"]`
  - Text content: `.md`, `.usertext-body`, `[data-click-id="text"]`
- Added author extraction for Reddit comments
- Implemented Reddit-specific user detection (edit button presence, username matching)
- Added extensive debug logging to track conversation extraction

## Debug Features Added

All functions now include comprehensive debug logging that can be viewed in the browser console:
- Text area detection logs
- Content extraction/setting logs
- Conversation history scanning logs
- Keyboard event handling logs
- Text replacement verification logs

## Testing

A Reddit-like test page has been created at `/workspace/test-reddit.html` that simulates:
- Reddit's various input types (standard input, Draft.js, Lexical editor)
- Reddit's comment structure for context extraction
- All the UI patterns that caused issues

## How to Verify Fixes

1. **Test Enter Key Fix:**
   - Type text in a Reddit post/comment
   - Press Alt+Q to refine
   - When replacement UI appears, press Enter
   - Text should be replaced immediately

2. **Test Title Box Detection:**
   - Click on Reddit's "Create a post" title field
   - Press Alt+Q or Alt+X
   - Extension should detect and work with the title field

3. **Test Context Detection:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Navigate to a Reddit thread with comments
   - Press Alt+Q on a reply box
   - Check console for `[ChatRefinement] Scanning conversation history` logs
   - Should see detected comments and authors

## Technical Notes

- Reddit uses React with Draft.js/Lexical for rich text editing
- Content must be set using specific event sequences to trigger React updates
- Reddit's DOM structure varies between old Reddit, new Reddit, and mobile views
- The fixes are backward compatible and won't break functionality on other sites
